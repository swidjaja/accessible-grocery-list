# accessible-grocery-list

I created this simple HTML page to demonstrate what I believe a good accessible Web page should be. 

Below are the list of accessibility features found on this page
- Important page contents are completely navigatable by just using keyboard. This is accomplised by adding appropriate tabindex to important page contents.
- We display a clear error message when user attempts to add blank entry. The text is displayed in bold red color which should be pretty visible. I added this error message div with role="alert" which will be spoken out by screen reader. For successful adding, we will display a clear successful message which will also be spoken out by screen reader.
- All links and buttons in the page can be operated on by using keyboard and mouse.
- I provide couple of links in the page that will allow users to jump easily to the important parts of the page. This will save users from having to do a lot of 'tabbing' to go to certain part of page.

There might be more areas that I haven't covered. Any suggestion is welcomed! Thank you!
